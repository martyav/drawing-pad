# To-Do

* [Add drop down menus for cap and join](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp)
* Make this into a github page
* ~~Wire up event handlers correctly~~
* ~~Figure out how all the variable switching will be happening~~
* Debug debug debug:
    * ~~LastX & lastY are behaving oddly...strokes are often drawn far to right of cursor~~
    * Solution to above: Canvas was being stretched via CSS to fit space on page; you need to set the width and height to offsetWidth & offsetHeight with Javascript to account for the change in size when styling kicks in
